For this assignment, I leveraged AI by asking it what is the best way to iterate through an array
and sum up all the integers. This is why I used the .reduce function. I also prompted ChatGPT
to create the reset function which I found to work seamlessly. For additions to the project,
I coded a 'critical hit' feature (similar to the actual Pokemon games) if the randomly generated 
'pokeMultiplier' is equal to or over 0.9. Lastly, I tried to leverage ChatGPT to create a battle log,
however I was unhappy with integrating the battlelog into the UI. The page either got too cramped
or the HTML kept overlapping. Instead I AI generated the CSS for the winner and loser animations 
and added that to display after the fight result was calulated.
